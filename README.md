PYTHON CUSTOM CALCULATOR
Version Python 3.7.9

This program is intended to calculate the user's input which is the price of their choice of cannabis strain, with the local county, dispensary, and state tax. Full disclosure: the values behind county, dispensary, and state tax are fictional. This program is merely created to estimate how much the taxes could cost alongside your cannabis strain.

This program will ask for one input only: your cannabis retail price. This program will then calculate your value with the built-in tax values and print your total cost.
